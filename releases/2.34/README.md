# 2.34 Upgrade Notes

## Tomcat support

- Minimum required Tomcat version is now **8.5.50**. Support for Tomcat 7.0 and 8.0 is now dropped. The main reason for this change is Tomcat 7.0 and 8.0 having several issues with certain application development frameworks (most importantly _Jackson_, used for JSON and XML serialization) used internally by DHIS 2.
